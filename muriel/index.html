      <h1>Muriel Cooper</h1>

      <p>
        I became slightly obsessed with this piece, a poster for the Media Lab. No
        doubt a product of a mechanical process, I found the emergent lines,
        noise, and decay that connects the different letters really engaging. How
        much noise before something is unreadable? I couldn’t find a very
        high-quality version of the piece, so this is what I was working with:
      </p>
      <img style="width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/muriel/img/reference.jpeg" />
      <p>
        It struck me as looking sort of like a riso print, so I scrounged around
        for some examples of “making riso prints” in p5, which, luckily,
        <a href="https://antiboredom.github.io/p5.riso/">Sam Lavigne and company had done for me.</a>

        To start, I turned each letter into a dot array at a certain resolution.
        Then, added some noise to each point’s alpha and position, dependent on
        how far down the letter it is. Adding some additional color layers gives a
        nice effect, too.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img style="width: 30%" src="/muriel/img/a.png" />
        <img style="width: 30%" src="/muriel/img/b.png" />
        <img style="width: 30%" src="/muriel/img/c.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        This isn’t quite right. if you look at the example above, the “noise”
        follows a kind of line. This led me to create a “noise threshold”
        generated using perlin noise that cuts through each character, making a
        nice effect IMO, but it’s quite harsh (left). I fixed this by increasing
        the likelihood that points follow some random noise the closer they are to
        this line (right)
      </p>
      <div style="
        width: 100%;
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 45% 45%;
        justify-content: space-evenly;
        justify-items: center;
        align-items: top;
      ">
        <div>
          <img style="width: 100%" src="./img/curve1.png" />
          <span>A strict line is too harsh...</span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img style="width: 100%" src="./img/curve2.png" />
          <span>But increasing the likelihood of random “clouding” of points as they
            approach the same line is much smoother and closer</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This came pretty close in my view. Mapping point’s alpha to the y-axis
        withine ach letter also helped. If I were to spend more time—I think the
        points need to be more spatially contained, and alpha should be more
        liberally applied past the “noise line” instead of randomness.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I do like the overall effect below. The riso package I used allows for exports that are compatible with real
        riso printers! If I ever get my hands on one I'd love to print out a few of these.
